If you have Python and Linux, you should have everything you need. If the supplied versions of requests and yappi don't work, you can install these with pip (pip install <egg>). Note that this code was written with Python 2.7. It hasn't been migrated to Python 3, but that should be mostly easy with the 2to3 tool.

If you want to go to that much trouble, then you should also find all except blocks that use StandardError, and add a statement before them like this:

except KeyboardInterrupt:
	raise

This is because StandardError was removed for Python 3, and the above is necessary so that keyboard interrupts still work properly.

This hasn't been tested on Windows, and it's possible that a few minor things would need to be tweaked, but overall there are no major differences.
